    Shader descriptor structs:

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_offscreen':

                },

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_display':

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_diffuse_texture = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':
